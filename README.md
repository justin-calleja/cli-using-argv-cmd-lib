This is an e.g. cli app built with [argv-cmd-lib](https://github.com/justin-calleja/argv-cmd-lib).

Built files are already committed in `lib` dir. You'll need to `npm link .` to get the executable `cli` command available on your system. Current `build` package.json script is using `chmod` (use equivalent on Windows).
